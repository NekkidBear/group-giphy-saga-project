-- Database name should be: giphy_search_favorites

-- Categories table:
CREATE TABLE "categories" (

-- Default categories. You may change these. ðŸ™‚
INSERT INTO "categories"

-- Favorites table:

-- You'll need a "favorites" table for storing each instance of
-- a Giphy image that has been "favorited."
-- Each favorite image can be assigned one of the existing
-- categories via foreign key. This is a one-to-many relationship:
--    One favorite has one category.
--    One category can be had by many favorites.

-- Query for favorites
-- SELECT * FROM "favorites"
--   JOIN "categories" ON favorites.category_id = categories.id
--   WHERE category_id = $1
